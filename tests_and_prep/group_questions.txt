1. What is default order for GROUP BY? 
The default order of ORDER BY command is ascending order. 
So, if you didn't use ASC or DESC , results will come in ascending order.

2. if we don't specify which able a column refers to (aka name vs student.name), 
SQL will only work if there's one potential option

3. Database error - RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported
By doing a left join and switching the tables
